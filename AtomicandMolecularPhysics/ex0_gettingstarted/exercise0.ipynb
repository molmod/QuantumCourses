    "An array is like a list with the restriction that all elements have the same type. Most of the time, the type is either integer of floating point. The data can also be organized into rows and columns (i.e. two-dimensional array) to represent a matrix. [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) supports an arbitrary number of dimensions, *e.g.*, the Coulomb and exchange integrals are typically stored in a four-dimensional array. Unlike lists, once an array is created, it is not possible to remove or add elements. The number of elements is fixed once the array is created. The main advantage of arrays is the efficiency of numerical operations on these objects, similarly to Matlab and Octave."
